# Business-Analyst-Absenteeism-data-
This dataset looks very weird to me when I first encounter it.
This is a secondary data(data taken from third party) which doen't contain any empty variables.
\
Data preprocessing for this data set is one of the most intresting and insightful things that I have ever done while preprocessing the data.
features like Date, Reason for Absence are completely transformed into more meaningfu form so that it would be easy for Analysis.
Check points are mode inorder to save the effictiveness of code whenever it is required.
